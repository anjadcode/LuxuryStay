# Product Context – Hotel Web App

## Why This Project Exists
The hotel industry increasingly relies on digital platforms to manage bookings and guest experiences. This project serves as a modern, responsive web application that demonstrates hotel booking functionality while remaining lightweight and server-independent through the use of mock data. It provides a complete proof-of-concept for hotel management systems that can be easily extended to real backend integration.

## Problems It Solves
- **No Backend Dependency**: Eliminates need for server infrastructure during development and prototyping
- **Fast Development**: Enables rapid iteration on UI/UX without waiting for API development
- **Proof of Concept**: Demonstrates hotel booking workflows without complex backend setup
- **Scalable Foundation**: Provides architecture that can easily transition from mock data to real APIs
- **Mobile-First Experience**: Ensures guests can book rooms from any device

## How It Should Work
### Guest Journey
1. **Discovery**: Guests browse available rooms with intuitive search and filtering
2. **Selection**: Room details showcase amenities, pricing, and availability
3. **Booking**: Simple booking form with mock confirmation process
4. **Account Management**: Users can view booking history and manage profile (simulated)

### Admin Workflow
1. **Dashboard Overview**: Visual representation of hotel status and occupancy
2. **Room Management**: Full CRUD operations for room inventory
3. **Reservation Handling**: View, modify, and manage guest bookings
4. **Data Insights**: Quick access to booking trends and occupancy rates

## User Experience Goals
- **Intuitive Navigation**: Users should find what they need within 3 clicks
- **Instant Feedback**: All interactions provide immediate visual response
- **Responsive Design**: Seamless experience across all device sizes
- **Accessibility**: WCAG compliant for inclusive user experience
